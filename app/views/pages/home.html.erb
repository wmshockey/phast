<title>Phastline Pipeline Hydraulics Simulation Program from Phastware Consulting Ltd.  Free of charge and available to anyone interested in learning more about how a pipeline is constructed and operated.  This is a pipeline simulation and modeling application that provides reports of a pipeline's operational capacity, pressures, flowrates and power usage.  It uses industry standard formulas for calculating pipeline pressure loss, temperature variations in viscosity and density of fluids and both parallel and series combinations of pump curves.'</title>
<meta name="A batched pipeline hydraulics simulation application available to the general public free of charge.  This application models the operation of a pipeline by accepting a user specified pipeline configuration with pipe segments, stations with pumps and a set of nominations specifying the volume and types of products desired to be pumped through the line.  It will calculate pressures, capacity flowrates, bottlenecks and power usage at all significant times steps during the simulation."
